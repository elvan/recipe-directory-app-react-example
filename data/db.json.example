        "2 quarts buttermilk",
        "2 tablespoons kosher salt",

You can test if the oil is hot enough by dipping the tip of a wooden spoon in. If it bubbles rapidly, the oil is ready.\nDredge the chicken: Remove one chicken piece from the brine and let the excess drip off. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, coating it completely. Shake off any excess flour.\nFry the chicken: Carefully lower the chicken piece into the hot oil. Fry for 10-12 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature reaches 165°F). Do not overcrowd the pot, fry the chicken in batches if needed.\nDrain and rest: Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack set over a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
